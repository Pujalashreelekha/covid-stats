# covid-stats
Statistical analysis:
Firstly, the dataset for the covid dataset has been collected from the Kaggle. 
Then, it was cleaned and pre - processed in such a way that we can proceed for the analysis. 
Then the data has been explored and then visualised thoroughly. 
From the visualization, inferences and relations between the variables have been assumed. 
Then, the data has been converted to time series data in order to predict the future trends.

Static web - page to github:
These inferences and predictions are snapped and collectively kept in a single web page. 
Then this web page in visual code folder is pushed to github public repository. 

Deployment:
For deploying the web page, "static web app" service is used among all the app services.
We have to create a new static web app service and have to select the appropriate 'azure - subscription' and have to create a resource manager and then github account where the project repo is present needed to be connected. 
After connecting the azure service to proper repository, we need to review and create the static web app. 
If there is no problems or errors with the code or repo connections, the deployment will be started automatically. 
An url for the deployed website will be created and the web page content will be loaded on clicking this address with in a few moments. 

Deployed web page URL:
https://icy-pond-056831210.1.azurestaticapps.net

Conclusion:
This page can be opened by anyone who have this URL. Until we have the subscrpition, this deployment will be available and accessable. 
Due to the security provided by azure, this web page deployment will be safe and secured.
